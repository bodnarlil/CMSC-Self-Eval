# 500 Portfolio Template

Template for a Final Portfolio for CMSC 500 at Lawrence University.

## Guidelines

Your final portfolio allows you to showcase the work you have done for this course and make sense of it at the end of the term. It serves as your final piece of work for the class; you will use it to self-assign a grade for the course in your final reflection. 

**Put each piece of evidence in the appropriate folder.** You can either keep or delete the `.md` files which come with this repository; each folder needs at least one file in it to properly sync to GitHub. 

## Final Reflection Guidelines

The reflection can be as long or short as you need to accomplish the following three goals, but as a guideline, should probably be about 1 to 2 pages. There are no formatting rules. 

The goals for your written reflection are:

- **Self-assign a grade.** This will be your grade for the course unless there is a large (more than one-third letter grade) discrepancy between my assessment and yours, which there should not be if you've attended your check-ins.
- **Make some justifications for this grade using the pieces of evidence you have provided.** This can look like whatever you want it to look like. You can format it as a bulleted list, as paragraphs, as a table -- whatever makes sense for your brain.
- **Include both praise and critique.** No matter how you feel like you did, make sure you point out what you did well! Point out and own your successes. Include some compassionate critique too; where do you have capacity to grow? 


## Possible Pieces of Evidence

- In-Class Assignments/Projects 
- Hackathon 
- Final Project
- Paper Discussion 
- Class Notes
- Self-eval check-in sheets 
- Attendance
- Reading/engagement on Persuall 
- Possibly other things I haven't thought of!

You can use the same piece of evidence for up to 2 different learning goals. 

_When you make a copy, you can delete everything above here and use the below as a template._
