O = No files attached but completed

### L1: Evolution as an Algorithm
- [X] Hackathon: coding the tournament and roulette selection
- [X] Notes from first 5 weeks of class
- [X] C++ Code from week 3 (wrote notes in the WeekNotesFirstFive.pdf and in CMSC500W3D1.pdf)

### L2: Artificial Life as a Field

- [O] Participated in paper discusisions (Present in class for 3/4 (1 I was awak for a track meet but made comments on Perusall)
- [O] Put effort into Perusall comments and questions (On Perusall)
- [X] Was able to connect Artificial Life to my Machine Learning class through various topics like neural networks and modeling data

### L3: Computational Collaboration

- [O] Successfully used GitHub to push and pull code for a variety of classes (documented in my GitHub account)
- [X] Contributed documentation for Windows users for MABE 2 and created a slideshow to go with it
- [O] Went to Office Hours to set up/work through GitHub and learn about how to upload files for this self-eval

### L4: Failure

- [X] Code from week 1 did not work as intended
- [O] Worked and studied with peers outside of class and asked for help with code that would not run
- [X] C++ code from week 3 was not working but attempted to answer the questions anyways and worked with someone who did have it working (Subin)

- [X] Re-attempted Hackathon code after reviewing with peers and going to office hours
- [O] Went to office hours and worked through issues both during and after office hours
- [0] Completed the required self-eval check-in sheets and made sure to act on advice from those meetings (e.g. get hackathon code from someone who had some of it working (accidentally recycled these))
